# Gmail API Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating with the Gmail API and developing the email processing pipeline, which are the next priority features based on our project progress and user stories.

## User Stories Addressed

- "Automated Email Classification and Labeling"
- "Email Content Processing"
- "Easy Gmail Integration"

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Gmail API Integration (âœ… Completed)

- [x] Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
- [x] Implement secure token storage in the database
- [x] Create OAuth flow for user Gmail account authorization
- [x] Build API client wrapper with retry and error handling
- [x] Implement token refresh mechanism
- [x] Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
- [x] Create logging for API interactions
- [x] Use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` scope for read-only access

### 2. Database Schema Implementation (âœ… Completed)

- [x] Design schema for storing user accounts
- [x] Create tables for OAuth tokens and refresh tokens
- [x] Design schema for email metadata cache
- [x] Implement schema for user preferences and classification criteria
- [x] Add tables for label configurations
- [x] Create schema for processing history and statistics
- [x] Set up migrations system

### 3. Email Fetching and Sync (ðŸŸ¡ In Progress)

- [x] Implement incremental email fetching (newest first)
- [ ] Create efficient mechanism to detect new emails
- [ ] Build metadata extraction and normalization
- [ ] Implement content cleaning (HTML stripping, formatting)
- [ ] Create sync status tracking
- [ ] Implement error recovery for interrupted syncs

### 4. Label Management (âœ… Completed - Read-Only)

- [x] Create system for default label generation within the app
- [x] Implement label fetching and syncing from Gmail
- [x] Implement label storage in the app database
- [x] ~~Create label CRUD operations for Gmail~~ (N/A - Read-only mode)
- [x] ~~Add color and visibility management for Gmail labels~~ (N/A - Read-only mode)
- [x] ~~Create label hierarchy support~~ (N/A - Read-only mode)
- [x] Implement caching of label information

## Technical Considerations

### Security

- âœ… Store all tokens encrypted at rest
- âœ… Implement principle of least privilege for API access
- âœ… Regularly rotate refresh tokens
- âœ… Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Performance

- âœ… Implement batch operations where possible
- âœ… Use efficient pagination for email fetching
- âœ… Cache frequently accessed data
- âœ… Implement background processing for non-interactive operations

### Error Handling

- âœ… Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- âœ… Proper handling of rate limits and quota errors
- âœ… Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- âœ… Automatic retry with exponential backoff

## Dependencies

- âœ… Google API Client Library
- âœ… Secure token storage solution
- âœ… Database migrations system
- â¬œ HTML parsing library for email content cleaning

## Milestones

1. **Gmail Account Connection** - âœ… Completed
2. **Initial Sync** - ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
3. **Continuous Sync** - â¬œ Not Started
4. **Label Management** - âœ… Completed (Read-only)
5. **Processing Pipeline** - â¬œ Not Started

## Next Steps After Completion

Once Gmail API integration is complete, we'll focus on:

1. OpenAI integration for classification
2. Priority scoring algorithm
3. Dashboard improvements for visibility
